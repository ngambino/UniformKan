\section*{Potential Generating Left Classes}

In the following, we will examine different choices for the subcategory of generating left maps $\cal{I} \subseteq \SSet^{\to}$.
Objects in $\cal{I}$ will always at least be classical trivial cofibration, and hence also monomorphisms.
Most of the time, we will actually choose $\cal{I}$ as a subcategory of $\SSet_{\text{cart}}^{\to}$ consisting of arrows and \emph{cartesian} commutative squares for reasons now explained.

\subsection*{The problem with non-cartesian choices of $\cal{I}$}

Consider a non-cartesian morphism $j \to k$ in $\cal{I}$
\[
\xymatrix{
  A
  \ar[rrr]
  \ar[dd]_{j}
  \ar[dr]
&&&
  C
  \ar[dd]^{k}
\\&
  C'
  \ar[urr]
  \ar[dl]_{k'}
  \pullback{dr}
\\
  B
  \ar[rrr]
&&&
  D
}
\]
where we have drawn in the pullback for comparison.
Note that $A \to C'$ and $C' \to B$ are all monomorphisms, and that $A \to C'$ will not be invertible.

Fix a lifting problem
\[
\xymatrix{
  A
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{j}
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  B
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[ur]^{d}
&
  Y
}
\]
for a generating left map $j : A \to B$ and a right map $p : X \to Y$.
The algebraically generated solution is denoted $d$.
For any factoring
\[
\xymatrix{
  A
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{j}
&
  C
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_(0.35){k}
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  B
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[urr]^(0.3){d}
&
  D
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[ur]_{e}
&
  Y
}
\]
through $j \to k$ of this lifting problem, we have coherence of the algebraically generated lifts $d$ and $e$ as indicated.
It follows that $d$ is a lift for the inner square in
\[
\xymatrix{
  A
  \ar[rrr]
  \ar[dd]_{j}
  \ar[dr]
&&&
  X
  \ar[dd]^{p}
\\&
  C'
  \ar[urr]
  \ar[dl]_{k'}
\\
  B
  \ar[rrr]
  \ar@{.>}@/_2em/[uurrr]_{d}
&&&
  Y
}
\]
as well.

If $B \to D$ is a monomorphism, it is usually part of a section-retraction pair (for example, if $B$ and $D$ are both representable).
Given \emph{any} solution $d'$ to the above lifting problem $j \pitchfork p$, this can be used to define a factoring of $j \to p$ through $j \to k$ as above, using $d'$ to define the map $C \to X$.
This forces the algebraically generated lift $d$ to agree with the arbitrary lift $d'$ not just when restricted to $A$, but also when restricted to $C'$.
By transitivity, \emph{all} solutions $d'$ agree when restricted to $C'$.

This seems very unlikely.
For many non-cartesian choices of $\cal{I}$, we can even arrange in $D$ for the image of $B$ to lie in the image of $C$.
The base change $k'$ then becomes the identity, implying lifting problems $j \pitchfork p$ have \emph{unique} solutions.

\subsection*{Uniform with respect to cartesian product}

Let $\cal{I}$ be given as the product of $\cal{I'}$ with $\Delta$ where the objects of $\cal{I'}$ are the horn inclusions $h_i^n : \Lambda_i^n \to \Delta^n$ and we have three obvious options for the morphisms.

\paragraph{Option One}

We can have $\cal{I'}$ discrete.

\paragraph{Option Two}

We can let $\cal{I'}$ be a full subcategory of $\SSet_{\text{cart}}^{\to}$.
But a morphism
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Lambda_i^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]
  \pullback{dr}
&
  \Lambda_{i'}^{n'}
  \ar[d]
\\
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^{n'}
}
\]
being cartesian is equivalent to the bottom being an isomorphism.
We thus recover the first option.

\paragraph{Option Three}

We can let $\cal{I'}$ be a full subcategory of $\SSet^{\to}$.
Note that the bottom map $t : [n] \to [n']$ in
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Lambda_i^n
  \ar@{.>}[r]
  \ar[d]
&
  \Lambda_{i'}^{n'}
  \ar[d]
\\
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^{n'}
}
\]
extends to the top precisely in the following disjoint cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item
we have $(n, i) = (n', i')$ and $t = \id$,
\item
we have $n' = n + 1$ and $t = d_{i'}^{n'}$,
\item
there is $a' \neq i'$ not in the image of $t$.
\end{itemize}

Note that in the third case, the image of $t$ lies in the image of the right vertical map.
Since every object of $\cal{I'}$ occurs as the left vertical map of a situation as in case three with the bottom map furthermore a mono
morphism, the reasoning from the previous section will force the class of right maps to have \emph{unique} lifting solutions.
This makes this case undesirable.

Every object of $\cal{I'}$ furthermore occurs as the left vertical map of a situation as in case two.
Since the bottom map is a monomorphism, we can again apply the reasoning from the previous section.
Note that the base change of $\Lambda_{i'}^{n'}$ along $d_{i'}^{n'}$ is the boundary inclusion $\partial \Delta^n \to \Delta^n$.
Thus, the right class of maps will have \emph{unique opposite face filling}.
This makes this case undesirable as well.

\paragraph{Conclusion}

The only sensible (and also intuitively most natural option) is to have $\cal{I} = \cal{I'} \times \Delta$ where $\cal{I'}$ is the \emph{set} of horn inclusion.

\subsection*{Uniform with respect to join, first try}

Let $\cal{I}$ be the full subcategory of $\SSet_{\text{cart}}^{\to}$ on objects generalized horn inclusions $h_A^n : \Lambda_A^n \to \Delta^n$ with $\emptyset \neq A \subsetneq [n]$.
A morphism
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Lambda_A^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{h_A^n}
  \pullback{dr}
&
  \Lambda_{A'}^{n'}
  \ar[d]^{h_{A'}^{n'}}
\\
  \Delta^{n}
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^{n'}
}
\] 
is given by a map $t : [n] \to [n']$ such that $t^{-1}(A') = A$ and $t|_{[n] - A} : [n] - A \to [n'] - A'$ is bijective.

%Note that in principle we could disallow the case $A = \emptyset$.
%Since $\cal{I}$ is discrete on horn inclusions of the form $h_{\emptyset}^n : \Delta^n \to \Delta^n$, \ie $\cal{I} = \cal{I'} + \braces{h_{\emptyset}^n \mid n \geq 0}$ for some category $\cal{I}$, and all simplicial maps trivially have right lifting with respect to these maps, this would not make any difference.
%% WRONG: the type of $h_{\emptyset}^n$ is $\partial \Delta^n \to \Delta^n$ according to the iterated Leibniz join decomposition!

Note that the objects are equivalently given by iterated Leibniz joins in augmented simplicial sets of the zero dimensional horn inclusion $h_0^0$ and boundary inclusion $i^0$ with at least one occurrence of each.
Under this representation, the morphisms are induced by cartesian maps
\begin{mathpar}
\xymatrix{
  0
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]
  \pullback{dr}
&
  0
  \ar[d]^{h_0^0}
\\
  \Delta^{-1}
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^0
}
\and
\xymatrix{
  0
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{h_0^0 \hatjoin h_0^0}
  \pullback{dr}
&
  0
  \ar[d]^{h_0^0}
\\
  \Delta^{1}
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^0
}
\end{mathpar}
from the Leibniz join of zero and two copies of $h_0^0$ to $h_0^0$.

This class is problematic for a new reason.
We will show that all right maps with non-empty fibers are trivial Kan fibration.
Fix a right map $p : X \to Y$ and consider a lifting problem with $n \geq 1$ as follows:
\[
\xymatrix{
  \partial \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{i^n}
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[ur]
&
  Y
}
\]
We are going to factor this lifting problem as follows:
\[
\xymatrix{
  \partial \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{i^n}
  \pullback{dr}
&
  \Lambda_{n+1}^{n+1}
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]_{d_{n+1}^{n+1}}
  \ar@{.>}[urr]
&
  \Delta^{n+1}
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[ur]
&
  Y
}
\]
The middle vertical map belongs to the left class, and any lift in the right square will induce a lift for the outer square.

The map $\Delta^{n+1} \to Y$ is constructed from the retraction $s_n^n$ to $d_{n+1}^{n+1}$.
This leaves the map $t : \Lambda_{n+1}^{n+1} \to X$, which has to yield the map $\partial \Delta^n \to X$ when precomposed with $\partial \Delta^n \to \Lambda_{n+1}^{n+1}$ and needs to satisfy commutativity of the right square.
For $\emptyset \neq A \subsetneq [n]$, let $t_A$ denote the algebraically given filler below:
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Delta^{[n] - A}
  \ar[rr]
  \ar[d]_{h_{[n] - A}^{[n+1] - A}}
&&
  \partial \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]^{i^n}
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  \Delta^{[n+1] - A}
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[urrr]^{t_A}
&
  \Delta^{n+1}
  \ar[r]_{s_n^n}
&
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
&
  Y
}
\]
Note that the left vertical here is a generalized horn inclusion with all faces but one missing.
For $B \subseteq A$, the lifts $t_A$ and $t_B$ will be coherent as show
n below:
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Delta^{[n] - A}
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]
  \pullback{dr}
&
  \Delta^{[n] - B}
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]
&
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
\\
  \Delta^{[n+1] - A}
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[urr]^(0.4){t_A}
&
  \Delta^{[n+1] - B}
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[ur]_{t_B}
&
  Y
}
\]
Taking the colimit over the poset of those $A \subsetneq [n]$ with $1 \leq |A| \leq 2$, we derive a lift $t$
\[
\xymatrix{
  \partial \Delta^n
  \ar[rr]^{\id}
  \ar[d]
  &&
  \partial \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]^{i^n}
  &
  X
  \ar[d]^{p}
  \\
  \Lambda_{n+1}^{n+1}
  \ar[r]
  \ar@{.>}[urrr]^{t}
  &
  \Delta^{n+1}
  \ar[r]_{s_n^n}
  &
  \Delta^n
  \ar[r]
  &
  Y
}
\]
fulfilling all required commutativity constraints as indicated.

\subsection*{Uniform with respect to join, second try}

Note that the problems in the previous attempt were caused by the morphisms
\[
\xymatrix{
  \Lambda_A^n
  \ar[r]
  \ar[d]_{h_A^n}
  \pullback{dr}
&
  \Lambda_{A'}^{n'}
  \ar[d]^{h_{A'}^{n'}}
\\
  \Delta^{n}
  \ar[r]
&
  \Delta^{n'}
}
\] 
in $\cal{I}$ with $[n] \to [n']$ injective.
We could instead restrict $\cal{I}$ to only include the morphisms with $[n] \to [n']$ surjective.
But this does not seem to buy us much.

\subsection*{Uniform with respect to join, third try}

Instead of generalizing filling of horns from one missing face to a set of missing faces, we can generalize to horn-like inclusions that still have a distinguished vertex in the direction of which the filling is going to be, but can possibly have other vertices degenerated.

In detail, for any $n \geq 2$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$, let $C_k^n$ be the full subcategory of $\Delta/[n]$ consisting of surjective maps $t : [m] \to [n]$ under which $k$ has exactly one preimage.
We have a faithful functor $I_k^n : C_k^n \to \SSet_{\text{cart}}^{\to}$ injective on objects given by pulling back $h_k^n : \Lambda_k^n \to \Delta^n$.
Let us identify $I_k^n$ with its image.
Note that the objects of $I_k^n$ and $I_{k'}^{n'}$ are disjoint for $(n, k) \neq (n', k')$.
Finally, let $\cal{I}$ be the disjoint union of the subcategories $I_k^n$.

Note that we could in principle extend $C_k^n$ to non-surjective maps $t : [m] \to [n]$: we would have $I_k^n(t) = \id_{\Delta^m}$.
This would not make any difference except for the technical inconvenience of not having $\cal{I}_k^n$ as subcategories.
Nonetheless, the proper treatment consists of having a functor $\cal{I} \to \SSet_{\text{cart}}^{\to}$ instead of a subcategory.

It appears this does not solve the problem of the first try.
The subcategory $\cal{I}_0^1$ is all that is needed to replay the same argument.
